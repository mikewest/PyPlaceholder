PyPlaceholder
=============

When mocking up layouts, I want to ensure that the HTML I'm building wraps
_real_ images in the correct aspect ratios.  I also want to be able to fiddle
with the sizes without getting distracted by squashed/stretched faces.  I'd
like something akin to a visual "Lorem ipsum...", that says "Hey!  An image
is going to go here!  At some point!"  Importantly for some future work, I
want these images to be autogenerated.

So, `PyPlaceholder`.  Using [`PyPNG`][pypng] as a base, it generates s very
simple image that you can stick into a layout to hold the place of images 
to come.

    Usage: placeholders.py [options]

    Options:
      --version             show program's version number and exit
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --verbose             Verbose mode
      -o OUT, --output=OUT  Output file
      --background=RRGGBB   Background color in hex (`RRGGBB`) format
      --foreground=RRGGBB   Foreground color in hex (`RRGGBB`) format
      --width=WIDTH         Width of placeholder
      --height=HEIGHT       Height of placeholder
      --no-border           Suppress rendering of border around the placeholder
                            image.
